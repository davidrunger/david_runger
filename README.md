# david_runger / davidrunger.com

This is a Ruby on Rails web app that powers my personal website.

The [root page][1] contains some basic information about me and my experience in web development.
This page is built using Vue.js, which is kind of overkill, but I did it because I like the
development experience of hot module replacement so much, and that was easy to setup using Rails 5.
Plus, I wanted to get some more experience with Vue.

I also use this Ruby on Rails app to serve the Vue.js app that I use to keep track of my grocery
list: [davidrunger.com/groceries][2] (sign in with Google required).

The app is hosted by Heroku.
