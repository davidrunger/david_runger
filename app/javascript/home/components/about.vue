        p I'm a full stack web developer.

        p.
          I love the Ruby programming language, the Rails web development framework, and the RSpec
          testing library. These are well-designed tools with strong supporting ecosystems that
          allow me to work efficiently and to have fun doing it.

        p.

          I have been a support engineer at #[a(href='https://www.commonlit.org/') CommonLit],
          a software engineer and support engineer at Hired
          (now part of #[a(href='https://www.lhh.com/us/en/hired/') LHH]),
          a web development boot camp teaching assistant at
          #[a(href='https://www.appacademy.io/') App&nbsp;Academy], a high school math teacher, a
          public bus driver, and a long haul truck driver.
